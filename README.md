In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Resources used in completion of challenge:
    - Lecture Slides, Class Recordings, Tutoring session w/ Mark Fullton, and AskBCS sessions with Ashwin Bhatnagar & Tristen Ortiz
